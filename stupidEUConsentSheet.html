Also, journals may require that certain data from the study that does not directly identify you (i.e., de-identified survey responses) be made available to other researchers for further research projects. </li>
  <li>Improve the quality, design and safety of this study and other research studies.</li>
  <li>Conduct additional studies with the data collected in this study to advance scientific research and public health.
